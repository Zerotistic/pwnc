Mapping binja local variables is quite annoying, stack variables are simple to encode since they are static. However temporary register variables are a bit more complicated, the hlil needs to be parsed to determine when the variable goes in and out of scope, then the proper dwarf scope need to be generated for all those variables. Mapping arguments is also annoying, we only really know where the parameter values are in the prologue of the function before those registers are clobbered. It might be possible to search every possible register and stack value for the parameter locations, but it is probably not worth it. `decomp2dbg` is pretty clever when determining what line to match, they find the exact LLIL instruction at the current pc, then lookup the hlil that contains that LLIL instruction. The HLIL addresses are unreliable, since they can be formed from many disjoint blocks of LLIL.
